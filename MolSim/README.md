* Revision: 36ff4bf
* Compiler: gcc 11.4.0

## Task 1 ##
* Working with C++ works easily with Linux through VM or dual boot.
* With WSL there were more problems with installing packages.

## Task 2 ##
* Calculation of force, x and v of each particle for planet and comet simulation with the formulas introduced in the first week:
* Calculation of force with: Fi = SUM Fij with Fij = (MiMj * (xj-xi))/(||xi-xj||2^3)
* Calculation of new position x : xi(tn+1) = xi(tn) + ∆t * vi(tn) + (∆t)^2 * Fi(tn) / 2mi
* Calculation of new velocity v : vi (tn+1) = vi(tn) + ∆t * (Fi(tn) + Fi(tn+1)) / 2mi

## Task 3 ##
* Compile with all options enabled.
* run ./MolSim <path_to_file>/eingabe-sonne.txt
* If you want to change delta_t please use flag -d <value>.
* If you want to change end_time please use flag -e <value>.
* Visualization of the movements of the sun, earth, jupiter and Halley's Comet (see labeled image in folder)
* Stationary celestial body in the center is the sun, the planet orbiting it in close distance is Earth, the other planet orbiting it with more distance is Jupiter
* Guesses for the two planets orbiting the sun were made using the orbital periods of both planets in relation to each other
* The far more distant celestial body should be Halley's Comet, which orbits the sun with a very long orbital time and accelerates more the nearer it is to the sun


## Task 4 ##
* Refactoring:
  * Encapsulated Particle into ParticleContainer that can contain multiple particles in a Single Linked List
  * Single Linked List should be a good data structure for particle/molecule simulation tasks as it enables you to iterate through all particles very quickly and faster than in other data structures since the order in which you access the particles/molecules in a time step does not matter
  * Random access is not needed so you can do without the extra overhead other data structures need and can speed up the simulation process
* I/O:
  * Input immediately through command line from the beginning not while program runs
  * File name is needed to run the program, other values are optional and have default values if not specified
  * Possibility to easily add more options to the two already existing (delta_time and end_time) through existing structure
  * Output is generated by default in cmake-build-debug with both vtu- and xyz-files for the simulation
* Documentation:
  * Doxygen option (BUILD_DOC) is on as default. But it can be set off in CMakeLists.txt
  * If you want to use doxygen please make sure you have it installed.
  * run make doc_doxygen
* Compiler Warnings:
  * We cleaned up compiler warnings in our own code, but left the ones in the already existing code alone as to not break anything accidentally
