* Branch:   master
* Revision: insert last commit number
* Compiler: gcc 11.4.0

If you do not specify compiler and relevant flags, and we cannot simply compile with whatever compiler we have immediately on hand, then you will lose marks for uncompilable code!

## Task 1 ##
* Working with C++ only works with Linux through VM.

## Task 2 ##
* Calculation of force, x and v
* C++ requires a lot of brackets for the calculations

## Task 3 ##
* visualization of sun, moon, earth and Halley's Comet.
* Compile with all options enabled
* run ./MolSim <path_to_file>/eingabe-sonne.txt
* video see:

## Task 4 ##
* Refactoring and documentation

If you have any further comments for your submission...

If you cannot finish all tasks or still have bugs in your code submit videos and pictures with explanations of the errors anyway. This helps during the grading. Otherwise it might be assumed that you did not do these tasks at all!

You do not have to use the README markdown - you can also write it in latex or word as a report and submit as a PDF. The report/readme is only accepted as a markdown file (.md) or a PDF!

Code structure and tidiness are very important in software engineering and we will deduct a significant amount of marks for ugly code. We will not spend hours trying to understand unreadable code.
